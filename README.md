# ArtisansBeadStudio
This is the collaboration project with Bead Keychain Design Platform and Art Gallary. 

The Art Gallary project is a Web app for "Image upload" like Gallery in our Phones, or Google Photos. In this app, the user can have the space where they can check out the list of Albums which stores the images and further, can check image details and can edit or delete the image details which is basically CRUD Operations for Image table.

The Bead Keychain Design Platform is the Web app could replace the bead design board in the real world. It allows users to store their beads online, including uploaded the image of beads to visualize exact look of that specific bead. They can CRUD the bead on the website. There is the list of bead colour which allows user to see all the beads in that specific colour. Also, users can CRUD the colour on the website. Besides the beads themselves, there is keychain option which allow user to create their own keychain online! They can add/remove the bead to specific keychain, in that specific keychain, they can see the pictures of all the beads in that specific keychain. They can also CRUD the keychain to manage their design.

## Functions
There are several extra functions for this collaboration project.
- It allows users to associate/unassociate styles (from Art Gallary) to a keychain (from Bead Keychain Design Platform).
- Also, inside the style page, users can see all the keychains link to that specific style.
- Beside that, the authetication is used for differentiating the Admin user and the Guest users. The Admin user can manage all the keychains created online, while the Guest users can only manage the keychains created by their own.

## Build Status ðŸ‘¾
The current status is that there is CRUD Functionality for all the Tables in our project.
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) for Bead.âœ…
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) for BeadColour.âœ…
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) for Image.âœ…
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) for Keychain.âœ…

## Tech/Framework ðŸ’»
- ASP.NET MVC: Utilize the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for building the web application.
- Entity Framework: Use Entity Framework with a Code-First approach for managing the database schema and migrations.
- Web API: Create Web API controllers to handle data retrieval and manipulation, facilitating collaboration between the projects.
- Razor Views: Design Razor views (.cshtml files) to generate dynamic HTML content for displaying data to users.
- Collaboration: Establish a connection between the "styles" table from the art gallery project and the "keychain" table from the bead-making project, allowing seamless exploration of keychains by style and vice versa.
- Migration: Implement database migrations to manage and update the database schema as the project evolves.
